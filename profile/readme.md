# CloudStudio.DeviceModels.Scripts

This repository contains official parsing scripts for custom device models on the Cloud Studio platform.

## 📦 What Are Parsing Scripts?

Parsing scripts are designed to extend Cloud Studio’s compatibility with IoT devices that are not natively supported. They are used inside **Gear Studio**, enabling the interpretation and transformation of incoming and outgoing data according to specific device protocols.

## 🔧 Script Features

Each script may support one or more of the following features:

- **Inbound Parsing (Uplink):** Transform raw binary or structured payloads into meaningful data such as temperature, humidity, or device status.
- **Outbound Command Generation (Downlink):** Create device-specific payloads based on actions or commands initiated from Cloud Studio.
- **Device Configuration:** Define model metadata such as endpoints, types, relationships, and custom behaviors needed for accurate device modeling.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Integrate devices communicating over MQTT, HTTP, or LoRaWAN.
- Extend platform support for edge or legacy hardware.
- Customize device behavior and data presentation.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Browse and select the appropriate script for your device.
2. Import or embed the logic into your device model inside Gear Studio.
3. Adjust and validate the behavior using test payloads.
4. Deploy confidently with structured, readable data.

## 🤝 Contribute

We welcome contributions! If you've created a script that could benefit the community, feel free to submit a pull request.
